# Anomaly Detection in Data Center using Auto-Encoders
Building Anomaly Detection to identify unexpected Resource spikes from every CIs present in **Data Center**

## Introduction
Data centres produce large amount of data at 24/7, because of a lot of people consuming all kinds of Online Services every day and it produces two types of data i.e i) Application Logs ii) System Logs and this is rarely consumed for a benefit of a Business itself and by understanding its pattern could lead us Making DC runs smoothly, Saving a lot of Manhours, Less Maintenance etc, it would give a huge impact in IT Services.

- Consider a machine that solves it minor problems by itself and that could possibly avoid some major future problems
- This is a concept of Auto-Healing, and this is possible by utilizing Scripts that could do some operations like 

  * Removes Junks that accumulates overtime
  * Clears Temporary files
  * Fixing Broken shortcuts etc.

- By applying Anomaly Detection on these logs the Master sever would suggest Worker nodes about what actions to take to overcome future issues.

## Architechture

#### Architechture Follows Two Approaches
* Proactive 
* Reactive
